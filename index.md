Welcome to the pages for the University College London Research Programming Hub.

The hub brings together research groups across the college who develop software for research. 

We are committed to:

* The development of high-quality, reusable, well-tested, reliable software for research
* The importance of readable code as a form of scholarly communication
* The recognition of software as a first-class scientific output alongside papers and data
* The value of best software engineering practices for research software
* The application of cutting edge numerical methods and computational tools to research

We achieve this through:

* Bringing together programming researchers in a variety of fields into a community of practice
* Sharing techniques, tools, approaches and ideas across disciplinary boundaries
* Helping each other achieve rigourous academic standards of quality and correctness in our software through review
* Teaching and training in scientific programming for our students
* Advocacy for the importance of good scientific software in UCL and more widely
