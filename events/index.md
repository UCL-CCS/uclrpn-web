We will be organising a series of events in UCL to bring the research programming community together.

One such thread will be the "Research Programming Technical Socials":

> Are you a UCL student or staff member who writes or uses software for research? 
> Would you like to? Is using or making software part of your scientific or scholarly life?

> Please join us for the 2015 UCL Research Computing Technical Socials.

> In these informal events, you can learn about useful tools and techniques which will help with your research
> while meeting other students and staff who use computers for science.

> These will be held regularly, 1630-1745, with a format as follows:

> 1630-1640: Initial mingling and settling in. Refreshments.
> 1640-1710: Short talk on a tool, program, environment, language or technique of general interest to programming researchers.
> 1710-1715: Break. Further refreshments.
> 1715-1745: Group discussion of a matter of interest to programming scientists, inspired by the talk or another question.
> 1745:      Retire to an appropriate social venue.

We're looking for volunteers to lead one of these events. If you're interested please contact j.hetherington@ucl.ac.uk
